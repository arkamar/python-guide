======================================
pypi â€” helper eclass for PyPI archives
======================================

.. highlight:: bash

The ``pypi`` eclass is a small eclass to facilitate fetching sources
from PyPI.  It abstracts away the complexity of PyPI URLs, and makes it
easier to adapt ``SRC_URI`` to their future changes.

Please note that PyPI archives are not always the best choice
for distfiles.  In particular, they frequently are missing tests
and other files important to Gentoo packaging.  Should that be the case,
other archives should be used.  Read the :ref:`source archives` section
for more information.

PyPI URLs
=========

Modern and legacy URLs
----------------------
The modern form of PyPI URLs include a hash of the distribution file,
e.g.::

    https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/20/2e/36e46173a288c1c40853ffdb712c67e0e022df0e1ce50b7b1b50066b74d4/gpep517-13.tar.gz

This makes them inconvenient for use in ebuilds, as the hash would have
to be updated manually on every version bump.  For this reason, Gentoo
settled on using the legacy form of URLs instead, e.g.::

    https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/source/g/gpep517/gpep517-13.tar.gz

It should be noted that legacy URLs are no longer supported and may stop
working at an arbitrary time.  Using the eclass is going to make
the migration to an alternative provider easier than inline URLs.

The path part of a legacy URL for a source package has the general form
of::

    /packages/source/${project::1}/${project}/${filename}

whereas the path for a binary package (wheel) is::

    /packages/${pytag}/${project::1}/${project}/${filename}

In both cases, ``${project}`` refers to the PyPI project name.
Technically, PyPI accepts any name that matches the PyPI project name
after `package name normalization`_.  However, this behavior is not
guaranteed and using the canonical project name is recommended.

The filenames and ``${pytag}`` are described in the subsequent sections.


Source distribution filenames
-----------------------------
The filename of a source distribution (sdist) has the general form of::

    ${name}-${version}.tar.gz

where ``${name}`` is the project name normalized according to `PEP 625`_
and ``${version}`` is the version following `PEP 440`_.  The project
name normalization transforms all uppercase letters to lowercase,
and replaces all contiguous runs of ``._-`` characters with a single
underscore.

For example, package ``Flask-BabelEx`` version ``1.2.3`` would use
the following filename::

    flask_babelex-1.2.3.tar.gz

However, note that source distributions predating PEP 625 are still
commonly found, and they use non-normalized project names, e.g.::

    Flask-BabelEx-1.2.3.tar.gz

In both instances, the top directory inside the archive has the same
name as the archive filename, minus ``.tar.gz`` suffix.  Historically,
``.zip`` distributions were used as well.


Binary distribution filenames
-----------------------------
The filename of a binary distribution (wheel) has the general form of::

    ${name}-${version}-${pytag}-${abitag}-${platformtag}.whl

Similarly to source distributions, ``${name}`` and ``${version}``
specify the normalized project name and version (normalization follows
the same rules and is specified in `binary distribution format`_
specification).

``${pytag}`` is the tag specifying Python version that the wheel was
built for.  This can be ``py2.py3`` or ``py3`` for pure Python wheels,
or e.g. ``cp39`` for CPython 3.9 wheels.  ``${abitag}`` specifies
the appropriate ABI (``none`` for pure Python wheels),
``${platformtag}`` the platform (``any`` for pure Python wheels).

For example, the modern wheel for the aforementioned package would be
named::

    flask_babelex-1.2.3-py3-none-any.whl

However, some distributions use older normalization rules specified
in `PEP 427`_.  In this case, runs of characters other than alphanumeric
characters and dots (``[^\w\d.]+``) are replaced by a single underscore.
Notably, this means that uppercase letters and dots are left in place.
In this normalization, the example wheel is named::

    Flask_BabelEx-1.2.3-py3-none-any.whl


Packages with matching name and version
=======================================
In the most common case, the upstream package will have exactly the same
name as the Gentoo package, and the version numbers will be entirely
compatible.  In this case, it is sufficient to inherit the eclass,
and it will automatically set a suitable default ``SRC_URI``.  The URI
will be equivalent to::

    SRC_URI="
        https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/source/${PN::1}/${PN}/${P}.tar.gz
    "

Note that ``SRC_URI`` is not combined between eclasses and ebuilds.
Should you need to fetch additional files, you need to explicitly append
to the variable or the default will be overwritten, e.g.::

    inherit distutils-r1 pypi

    SRC_URI+="
        https://github.com/pytest-dev/execnet/commit/c0459b92bc4a42b08281e69b8802d24c5d3415d4.patch
            -> ${P}-pytest-7.2.patch
    "


Customizing the generated URL
=============================
The default value may not be suitable for your package if it uses
a different project name, version numbers that are incompatible with
Gentoo or the legacy ``.zip`` sdist format.  The ``pypi_sdist_url``
function can be used to generate URLs in that case.  Its usage is::

    pypi_sdist_url [<project> [<version> [<suffix>]]]

with package defaulting to ``${PN}``, version to ``${PV}`` and suffix
to ``.tar.gz``.  For example, the Gentoo ``dev-python/markups`` package
uses title-case ``Markups`` project name, and so the ebuild uses::

    inherit distutils-r1 pypi

    SRC_URI="$(pypi_sdist_url "${PN^}")"


Fetching wheels
===============
In very specific cases, it may be necessary to fetch wheels
(i.e. prebuilt Python packages) instead.  The ``pypi_wheel_url``
function is provided to aid this purpose.  Its usage is::

    pypi_wheel_url [<project> [<version> [<python-tag> [<abi-platform-tag>]]]]

with package defaulting to ``${PN}``, version to ``${PV}``, python-tag
to ``py3`` and abi-platform-tag to ``none-any`` (i.e. indicating a pure
Python package).  For example, ``dev-python/ensurepip-setuptools``
does::

    inherit pypi
    SRC_URI="$(pypi_wheel_url "${PN#ensurepip-}")"

Note that wheels are ZIP archives suffixed ``.whl``, and they are not
unpacked by the package manager automatically.  You either need to
unzip it explicitly or use ``->`` to rename it, e.g. by appending
``.zip`` suffix.  Remember to add an explicit dependency
on ``app-arch/unzip`` as well.

The ``pypi_wheel_filename`` function is provided to aid getting
the wheel filename.  It has a matching synopsis::

    pypi_wheel_filename [<project> [<version> [<python-tag> [<abi-platform-tag>]]]]
